# ExReadline Tasks

## Completed

### Core Functionality
- [x] Two implementations: simple (Erlang IO) and advanced (full readline)
- [x] Proper terminal handling with raw mode support
- [x] Command history with persistence
- [x] Basic Emacs-style keybindings (Ctrl-A/E/B/F/K/U/W)
- [x] Arrow key support (with issues in escript mode)
- [x] Tab completion framework
- [x] Word-based movement and editing (Alt-B, Alt-F)
- [x] Kill ring (cut/paste) functionality
- [x] GenServer-based architecture
- [x] Basic test coverage

### Features
- [x] History file management
- [x] History navigation (Ctrl-P/N and arrow keys)
- [x] Simple prompt support (string-based)

## In Progress

- [ ] Fix arrow keys in escript mode (showing escape sequences)
  - [ ] Issue from mcp_chat: Arrow keys show ^[[A, ^[[B instead of navigating
  - [ ] Affects command history navigation
  - [ ] Works correctly in IEx but not in escript
- [ ] Fix Ctrl-P/N navigation in escript mode
  - [ ] Emacs keybindings show literal characters
  - [ ] Need better terminal handling for escripts
