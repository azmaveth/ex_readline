# ExReadline Tasks

## Completed

### Core Functionality
- [x] Two implementations: simple (Erlang IO) and advanced (full readline)
- [x] Proper terminal handling with raw mode support
- [x] Command history with persistence
- [x] Basic Emacs-style keybindings (Ctrl-A/E/B/F/K/U/W)
- [x] Arrow key support (now working in both IEx and escript modes)
- [x] Tab completion framework
- [x] Word-based movement and editing (Alt-B, Alt-F)
- [x] Kill ring (cut/paste) functionality
- [x] GenServer-based architecture
- [x] Comprehensive test coverage

### Features
- [x] History file management
- [x] History navigation (Ctrl-P/N and arrow keys)
- [x] Simple prompt support (string-based)
- [x] Escript terminal handling with direct TTY access
- [x] Automatic mode detection (IEx vs escript)
- [x] Robust escape sequence handling

### Recent Fixes (v0.1.0 â†’ v0.2.0)
- [x] Fixed arrow keys in escript mode (no longer showing ^[[A, ^[[B)
- [x] Fixed Ctrl-P/N navigation in escript mode
- [x] Implemented dual terminal handling approach:
  - Standard mode: Uses Erlang IO for IEx environments
  - Escript mode: Uses direct TTY access via system commands and file I/O
- [x] Added comprehensive test suite covering both environments
- [x] Terminal capability detection and automatic mode switching

## In Progress

Currently, all major functionality is working across both IEx and escript environments.
